Grounds for data processing
Your personal data is processed for the purpose of providing you the best NordVPN services under the legal basis of performance of the contract between you and NordVPN, as provided in our Terms of Service.

In cases where your personal data is processed on a separate consent basis, you have the right at any time to withdraw your consent to the processing of your personal data.

If you disagree with your data processing by NordVPN, you are free not to use the NordVPN Service, and to discontinue using it at any time. You may request us to discontinue processing of your personal data, in which case your data will be processed only as much as it is necessary to effect the discontinuation of your use of the NordVPN Services (e.g., final settlement, or deleting all personal data based on your email address), or finalizing other NordVPN鈥檚 legal relationship with you (e.g. accounting, invoicing, processing refunds).

Please ensure that nobody accesses and uses your devices without your consent.

In order to ensure security of the personal data, NordVPN employs various administrative, technical and physical security measures, however it is your responsibility to exercise caution and reason when using the NordVPN Services. You will be personally responsible if such action violates any third party鈥檚 privacy or any other rights, or any applicable law. Under no circumstances, NordVPN is liable for the consequences of your unlawful activities, your willful and negligent activities violating applicable laws or third party rights, as well as any circumstances, which may not have been reasonably controlled or foreseen.

This Privacy Policy may be modified and updated at any time, at our sole discretion, for any or no reason, and without liability, as indicated below. The date of the most current wording of the Privacy Policy is indicated at the top of the text. We ask all users to ensure that they are familiar with the most current wording of the Privacy Policy. The amendment of the Privacy Policy may be communicated to you by sending an email and/or by publishing the updated Privacy Policy on the NordVPN website. Please consider reviewing the Privacy Policy each time you use the NordVPN Services. Updates of the Privacy Policy come into force as of the moment when they are published.

You may not assign or transfer your rights or obligations under this Privacy Policy to any third party.
